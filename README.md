# Climate  Analysis to invest in surf shop
## Overview of the Project
The main purpose of this analysis is is to do a climate analysis before investing in surfing shop in Oahu Island. To do this, we explore a sqlite weather database. The project  also use SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect to sqlite database and automap_base() to reflect tables into classes and save a reference. We specifically want temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
